## Running Backend Server

Navigate to "backend" folder</br>
Run `npm install` to download all the dependencies</br>
Run `npm run start` to compile the code and run the server/compiled code</br>

## Database Design Explanation

We are using MongoDB since we won't be having fixed schema assuming there might be further considerations taken into 
the picture at a later stage.

We have two documents: transaction and payout notification.

transaction schema looks like 

	date: Date		
    amount: Number
    merchantId: String
    transactionType: String
	
payout notification schema looks like 

	date: Date
    partialAmount: Number
    transactionId: String
    merchantId: String
    splitId: String
    destinationAccount: String


Once we save the transaction in the database a id is generated by MongoDB which is later being used to map tp payouts documents
using transactionId in payout document. An assumption has been taked for SplitId. SplitId has been added into the payout document which can further be used in the future
to accommodate different amounts deduction (credit card usage, etc.). The database can further be extended to take into consideration
the different merchants so we can have a separate document having merchants data.

## Code Explanation

Our backend code has two APIs

1. /webhook/transaction

	Pay load required: 
	
	{
		"amount": 3000,
		"merchantId": "M3701",
		"transactionType": "AUTH" 
	}

	The payload contains the amount of the transaction, the merchantId which specifically starts with M in this case, and
	the transaction type that can be AUTH, DISPUTE, REFUND.
	
	The transaction is being saved in the database (MongoDB in our case) where we have two separate schemas, 
	transaction schema and payout schema.
	
	Once we receive the payload for the AUTH transaction, which should be hypothetically first be authorized using visa cards
	(here we assume that transaction type already has auth, refund or dispute), we process the payout for that particular transaction.
	
	For payout processing, we deduct 5% amount from the transaction amount and pay it into the deposit account of "valpay" 
	and the remaining amount is paid into the deposit account of the merchant.
	

2. /webhook/generateReport

	This API request is a get request which is basically triggered after end of the day and generates a report "transactionLedgeDayReport.csv"
	which contains the entries from both the documents (transaction and payout) and are added into the csv report.
